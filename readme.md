Amazon Echo + Salesforce Integration - Demo for JDF17 - Based on Echo Case Control Repo shared by Josh Birk
==========================================================================================================


This is a node.js application to be used with an Amazon Alexa Skill (for the Echo) to invoke Salesforce REST APIs.

Following the instructions below will let you:

1. Use an Amazon Echo to ask for total amount of opportunities closed today
2. Ask for total number of critical cases closed today
3. Narrow down the search for a specific account
4. Check for latest updates/comments on a specific case

Further details here are same from the Readme of this GitHub repository shared by Josh Birk : https://github.com/joshbirk/EchoCaseControl

Once you have it setup you should be able to start the interaction by saying:

>Alexa, Open Force Dot Com

Once connected you can ask for total number of opportunities closed today.

>What is the total amount of opportunities that we won today?

And Alexa will give us the total amount.
